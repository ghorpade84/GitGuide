Introduction to Git
Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and manage your projects efficiently.

Installation
Linux
Open your terminal.
Update your package index:
bash
Copy
sudo apt update
Install Git:
bash
Copy
sudo apt install git
Verify installation:
bash
Copy
git --version
Windows
Download the Git installer from Git for Windows.
Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
Ensure "Git Bash" is selected during installation.
Verify installation:
Open Git Bash and run:
bash
Copy
git --version
Setting Up SSH Key
Open your terminal or Git Bash.
Generate a new SSH key:
bash
Copy
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
When prompted, press Enter to accept the default file location.
Add your SSH key to the SSH agent:
bash
Copy
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:
bash
Copy
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Go to your Git hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):
Navigate to Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key.
Paste your key and save it.
Basic Git Commands
Clone a Repository
To make a local copy of a repository, use the git clone command:

bash
Copy
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
Create a Branch
Creating a branch is essential for working on features or fixes independently:

bash
Copy
git checkout -b new-feature
Pull Changes
To synchronize your local repository with the remote one and fetch updates:

bash
Copy
git pull origin main
Push Changes
After committing your changes, push them to the remote repository:

bash
Copy
git push origin new-feature
Sample File for Demo
Create a simple text file in your repository:

Navigate to your repository directory:
bash
Copy
cd repo
Create a sample file:
bash
Copy
echo "Hello, Git!" > demo.txt
Add the file to staging:
bash
Copy
git add demo.txt
Commit the changes:
bash
Copy
git commit -m "Add demo.txt file"
Push the changes to the new-feature branch:
bash
Copy
git push origin new-feature
